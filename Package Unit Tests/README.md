To catch these errors, we have to check for the quality and accuracy and the quality of your code. Proper testing is necessary to avoid unexpected surprises and have confidence in your results.

* TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT: a development process where you write tests for tasks before you even write the code to implement those tasks.


  * These tests can check for all the different scenarios and edge cases you can think of, before even starting to write your function.This way, when you do start implementing your function, you can run this test to get immediate feedback on whether it works or not in all the ways you can think of, as you tweak your function.
  * When refactoring or adding to your code, tests help you rest assured that the rest of your code didn't break while you were making those changes. Tests also helps ensure that your function behavior is repeatable, regardless of external parameters, such as hardware and time.



* UNIT TEST: a type of test that covers a “unit” of code, usually a single function, independently from the rest of the program.
  * The advantage of unit tests is that they are isolated from the rest of your program, and thus, no dependencies are involved. They don't require access to databases, APIs, or other external sources of information. However, passing unit tests isn’t always enough to prove that our program is working successfully.
